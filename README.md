# Brochain

I have built a chain of bros to document (fist) bumps without any centralized party, since #TrueBros are all equal. 

I was surprised to learn how a decentralized ledger worked! I kept on expecting the architecture to eventually point to some big unknown server somewhere (since that's the design pattern I'm used to), but this really is it. 

This is far from a blockchain, and I haven't implemented a token. The code is also all dumped into one file so I will need to reorganize it if I want more components.
